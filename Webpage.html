            <p><h5>Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications.
                <br>The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts.</br> The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules.
                NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular application is defined by a set of NgModules. An application always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, 
                and typically has many more feature modules.</h5></p>
